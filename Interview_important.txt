-In console,we can direcly execute the code.

Q what are operations in Js?
-operations in js are way to manipulate the data or we can say control the flow.We can use the loops,if else condition,switch to control the flow.

Q Tags in js?
-Script tag
-noscript tag-it is used to display some data when js is not enabled in browser.
-object and embed-they are used to embed various kind of content such as interactive applications and widgets.

Q How to create dynamic page in Js?
-By modifying the DOM , we can handle dynamic page.So we can fetch any elements and can attach an event-listener.
-By taking input from user we can handle the dynamic content.

Q Is JS synchronous or asynchronous?
-JS is single threaded. It is both depending upon the execution.
For async-> we can use callbacks,promises,async await.
So event loop is responsible for this. It constantly checks call stack and queues.

Q Difference between let, var and const?
-Var is global scoped whereas let and const block scoped.
-const variable when declared cannot be updated and reinitialised whereas let cannot be redeclared but cannot be updated and var can be both.

Q unshift and shift operator?
-These are used in array.
Unshift->adds new element at the beginning of the array and returns the length of an array.
Eg->let arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
arr.unshift(10);
output->6

shift->removes element from the beginning and returns the removed element.

Q prompt().
-It is used to display dialog box and takes input from the user.
-It pauses the execution of the code.

Q What is Hoisting?
-It is mechanism in which functions and variables declaration are moved on top.
-By this we can access them even before they are declared.

Q Difference between == and ===?
== is loose equality whereas === is strict equality.
== first converts both the values to common type through cohersion whereas === checks for datatype as well.

Q Strict in js?
- Strict is the more restricted variant in js.
By this we can prevent accidental declaration as it will throw an error.
We can also remove auto globals.

Q call,apply,bind in js?
-Call method Immediately invokes the function with first argument as this and rest can be arguments with comma separated.
-The only difference between the call and apply is apply takes arguments after this in array list ["",""]
-Bind returns the copy of the function and after this we can invoke the function.

Q What is Promise?
-Promise is a placeholder which will be filled later with a value
-Promise is an object that represents eventual completion or failure of the asynchronous completion.

How it solves the problem of inversion of control?
-so we can attach a callback function using .then. By this we dont give the access to another function rather we have a control of the function.

Q What is Promise chaining?
-It is concept in which we initialies another promise with the result of prev promise and we return from it.

Q What is Promise API?
-promise.all->it is used when we want to make multiple api calls.
There can be 2 cases-
1.If all the apis get success then it will display the collective results of all.
2.If any of the api fails then promise.all will throw an error immediately.

-promise.allSettled-It works same in case of success.
The difference lies in the failure case.
So lets say if 3 api calls were made and one of them gets failed so it will wait for everyone else to complete and then throw the result. So the result will be like [val1,error,val2];

-promise.race-It will return the result of first settled promise.In case of success it will give value and in case of error it will throw error.

-promise.any->It will wait until it gets resolve value.
If all the promises gets rejected then it will throw an aggregated error.

Q What is async?
-Async is a keyword to make the function async.

Q What is Async function?
-Async function always returns a promise.
If we will not return promise then it will wrap that value into promise and then return it.

Async and await are used to handle promises.

Q Difference between function and method?
So when function is made inside class then it is known as method.
